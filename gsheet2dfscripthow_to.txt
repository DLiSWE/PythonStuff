Project 1: How to use the script
Derek Li

Install an IDE(Pycharm/Visual Studio Codes/Jupyter/Sublime)..
Install Python 3.7
Install pip
Install gspread
Install df2gspread
Install service account credentials
Install pandas
Install numpy
Install python-crontab (schedule automation)
Install datetime

Open google apps developer and make an developer account
Create a service account oauth key. You should see it in the settings of the google sheets api. This is going to be your access key so make sure you save it. After you make the service key, you should be able to download it. Rename the key after you download it as service_account.json. Save it to the same folder the script is in.

Parts you have to change for every project:
1.gc.open(insert name of the project name on google sheets that you are exporting the data from in quotes).sheet1

2.SSID is the value in the url.                 
****This SSID is for the output sheet.

3. wks_name = The name of the output sheet in quotes.

*OPTIONAL

This is where you want the graph to start, ‘A1’ if you want to just have it normally without any spacing. If you want to add another dataset you can choose another cell and change it to the location you want it. If you want to do this, you must change the “clean” variable at the end of the script to False.


There are formulas throughout the sheet. They are pretty easy to understand if you take a close look at the script.



5. Input days left in month. Uses the formula (daily budget * days left in the month) + already spent, to calculate estimated spend for the month. It is only applied on the summary page. If you want it to apply for each campaign. The box pops up immediately after running the script so make sure you fill it in or you will be waiting for nothing. It might be a little hard to find if you have multiple windows open but it’s there.

6. The added formulas are sensitive. First sheet has to stay in whatever format supermetric exported it as. This becomes especially important when scheduling to automate this script.

7. ******OUTPUT ON GSHEET MIGHT HAVE LEADING APOSTROPHE IN DATA************
